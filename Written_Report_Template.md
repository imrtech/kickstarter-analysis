# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to determine how different campaigns performed in relation to the dates they launched and their funding goals.


## Analysis and Challenges

I started with the kickstarter worksheet and made sure that filters were turned off. I created the additional column required for the Year.I used the following function:

Year()

To use this function I referenced the cell that correspondended with the Date Created Conversion in the parentheses.
I then created a new pivot table that filtered for the Theater parent category and Years. I then added outcomes to values area as well as the columns area, and finally I added the Months (Date Created Converstion) to the rows area. From this result, I charted a line graph and entitled it Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date. I saved this image here:

I created a new worksheet for Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date. This included 8 new columns and 9 rows.

I created a new worksheet for Outcomes Based on Goal.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

May and June were the most successful launch months for the theater campaign. However, roughly 36% of the theater campaigns failed to meets its goals.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Of the 1047 Plays Campaigns, 694 were successful. 529 Campaigns with goals less than $1,000 and between $1,000 and $4,999 were the most successful. 

As the goals amount increased the less campsigns were launched.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
